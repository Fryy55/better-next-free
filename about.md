# Better "Next Free"
###### requested by [CarlIsBored](user:10748478)

This mod completely reimplements the "Next Free" button's... implementation? Now **all** your groups will be properly calculated - normally the editor counts stuff like triggers that target <cc>Control IDs</c> or the target item of <cl>Item Edit Triggers</c> towards the Next Free group, and doesn't count stuff like <cp>Move Trigger</c>'s center group. This mod fixes all these problems, while keeping <cg>performance</c> the same (or, maybe, makes it even better!)

### **<cf>Fixed objects:</c>**
- Move Trigger
- Stop Trigger
- Rotate Trigger
- Keyframe Animation Trigger
- Edit Advanced Follow Trigger
- Re-Target Advanced Follow Trigger
- Edit Area Triggers
- Area Stop Trigger
- Item Edit Trigger
- Advanced Random Trigger
- Sequence Trigger
- Gradient Trigger
- Checkpoint
- ALL collectibles (Keys, Hearts, Clocks, Pixel objects...)
